   \`\`\`

   Or simply download the \`index.html\` file.

## Customization

### API Integration

To connect this frontend to your backend API:

1. Locate the following lines in the \`<script>\` section of the HTML file:

   \`\`\`javascript
   const API_URL = "YOUR_API_URL";
   const API_TOKEN = "YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE";
   \`\`\`

2. Replace \`"YOUR_API_URL"\` with your actual API URL.
3. Replace \`"YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE"\` with your API authentication token.

### Styling

The application uses custom CSS for styling. To modify the appearance:

1. Find the \`<style>\` section in the HTML file.
2. Adjust the CSS variables in the \`:root\` selector to change the color scheme:

   \`\`\`css
   :root {
     --primary-color: #3498db;
     --primary-dark: #2980b9;
     --secondary-color: #2c3e50;
     --background-color: #f0f4f8;
     --card-background: #ffffff;
     --text-color: #333333;
     --border-color: #e0e0e0;
     --success-color: #2ecc71;
     --error-color: #e74c3c;
   }
   \`\`\`

3. Modify other CSS rules to further customize the appearance.

## Security Considerations

- This is a client-side application. Ensure that your backend API implements proper authentication and authorization.
- Never expose sensitive information like API tokens in the frontend code in a production environment.
- Implement HTTPS to secure data transmission between the client and your API.
